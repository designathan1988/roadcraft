/**
 * Offsets an open polyline by a signed distance `d` along `perp(tangent)`.
 *
 * The V6 monolith placed each offset vertex at exactly `d` along the *vertex
 * normal*. That is wrong: the intersection of the two offset lines sits at
 * `d / cos(theta/2)` from the source vertex, where `theta` is the turn angle.
 * Using `d` alone pulls every corner toward the centreline, which is why lane
 * markings drifted off the carriageway and self-crossed on curves.
 *
 * The `miterLen` expression below is signed-correct for both sides of a turn on
 * its own: the inner side gets a short miter, the outer a long one. That single
 * expression is the whole fix.
 *
 * What is NOT true, and is worth stating because it reads as if it should be:
 * the result's points do not all lie at perpendicular distance |d| from the
 * source polyline. On the concave side of a turn the miter vertex's nearest
 * feature is the source *vertex*, at `|d| / cos(theta/2)`. The invariants the
 * tests actually pin are the miter distance itself, and that every offset
 * vertex sits exactly `d` from the supporting lines of both adjacent source
 * segments — which is what "parallel at distance d" means. See the note at the
 * top of `tests/core/offset.spec.ts`.
