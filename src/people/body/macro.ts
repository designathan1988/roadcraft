/**
 * MakeHuman's macro sliders, as weights on its macro targets.

 * Everything here is read from the data (`modifiers.json`, which is MPFB2's
 * `macrodetails/macro.json`): each slider is a run of parts, each part a
 * stretch of the slider between two named states - age goes baby, child,
 * young, old - and a target is named by one state of every factor it
 * combines (`universal-female-young-averagemuscle-averageweight`,
 * `african-male-old`, `height/female-child-...-maxheight`). A target's weight
 * is the product of its states' weights; a state's weight is how far the
 * slider sits towards it inside its part.
 *
 * Written from the file format alone: no MakeHuman or MPFB code is used.
