/**
 * Fixed-timestep clock with an accumulator.
 *
 * The V6 monolith advanced the simulation by `min(0.04, elapsed)` with no
 * accumulator, so a 200 ms frame advanced it only 40 ms. Because its signal
 * phase was derived from that same clock, traffic lights literally ran slower
 * when the map got busy (defect 5.2).
 *
 * Two rules follow from the design and both matter:
 *
 *   - `speed` multiplies the rate at which wall time is fed into the
 *     accumulator, never `DT`. Changing simulation speed therefore cannot
 *     change physics.
 *   - Time is `tick * DT`, an exact integer multiple. Nothing accumulates
 *     floating-point drift, and while paused the tick does not advance at all,
 *     so nothing can expire or be renewed during a pause. That was the third
 *     limb of the stale-reservation defect (2.7).
