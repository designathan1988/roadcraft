/**
 * Vehicle classes, in world units.
 *
 * Dimensions are real, in metres through `m()`: a sedan is 4.7 m. The V6 monolith called a 9.6-unit vehicle a "sedan" against road
 * widths of 15 to 46 — roughly half scale relative to the carriageway, and the
 * mismatch is part of why its storage arithmetic came out negative.
 *
 * The fleet is deliberately mixed: hatchbacks and sedans dominate, with SUVs
 * and vans behind them, a scattering of motorcycles and bicycles, and buses
 * and trucks rare enough that meeting one is an event. The share is `weight`
 * and the shares sum to one, so the spawn draw needs no normalisation.
 *
 * Two groups of fields are carried here that the simulation itself never
 * reads. The first is `palette`: paint has to be picked at spawn from a
 * seeded stream, not at draw time, or a car changes colour whenever the
 * renderer is rebuilt. The second is the body plan — `shape`, `height`,
 * `cabinFraction`, `cabinShift`, `axles`, `seats`. That data lives here
 * because it is a property of the class, and because the alternative is a
 * chain of `if (id === 'truck')` tests inside the render loop, which is how
 * the old renderer ended up drawing a bus as a long hatchback. `src/sim` must
 * not import three, so these are plain numbers; the renderer turns them into
 * geometry.
