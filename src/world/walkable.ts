/**
 * The ground a pedestrian may stand on: the footway and its kerb, and never
 * the carriageway or the verge beyond.
 *
 * It is the same outline the road mesh draws (`world/surfaces.ts`), read as
 * rings and answered point by point through a `RegionIndex`: inside the
 * footway level, and outside the carriageway. No clipper union is needed —
 * the rings are combined by winding number — so building it costs about as
 * much as flattening the rings.
 *
 * The pedestrian navigation reads it once per network, to fit every walking
 * corridor to the footway that is really there (`sim/peds/corridor.ts`), and
 * the audits read it to check what the player sees.
