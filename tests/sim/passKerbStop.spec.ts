/**
 * NOBODY PARKS ACROSS TWO LANES.
 *
 * A car stops at the kerb to let somebody out. The car behind it, queued a
 * jam gap behind, pulled out to pass - and a lane change is a curve driven
 * over road: until its body was clear of the old lane it still followed the
 * stopped car, so it got a body length sideways and stopped there, across
 * both lanes, blocking the one it had moved into as well, for as long as the
 * kerb stop lasted. The same happened moving into a lane beside a queue that
 * was rolling up to a red. Measured on an avenue with kerb stops, before:
 * 43 such stalls in six five-minute runs, one of them 93 s long.
 *
 * Now a change is only started when the body can get out of the old lane
 * before whatever will be standing there stops it (`canLeaveLane`), a driver
 * stopping behind a car at the kerb leaves room to pull out round it
 * (`pullOutRoom`), and a body already clear of the car ahead in the old lane
 * is no longer held by it (`shadowLeaderObstacle`).
