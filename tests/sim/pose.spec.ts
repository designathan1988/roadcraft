/**
 * What the player sees, as opposed to what the simulation believes.
 *
 * The simulation was already smooth: `s` advances by `v * DT` and nothing
 * teleports. The RENDER pose was not, and it produced the reported defect of
 * cars "jumping position while driving":
 *
 *   - `vehiclePose` refused to interpolate at all whenever the vehicle had
 *     changed lanelet since the previous snapshot. Entering a junction
 *     connector, leaving one and changing lane are all lanelet changes, so
 *     the car snapped to its new centreline at exactly the three moments the
 *     eye is following it;
 *   - a lane change moved the vehicle a whole lane width sideways in one
 *     tick, with nothing carrying the displacement;
 *   - the heading was never interpolated, so a turning car rotated in
 *     discrete steps.
 *
 * These tests measure the drawn pose directly, tick by tick, against what the
 * vehicle's own speed makes possible.
