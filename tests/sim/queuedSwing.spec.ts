/**
 * A BUS TURNING OFF A SHORT LINK, AND THE CAR WAITING BESIDE IT.
 *
 * Two signalised T junctions 50 units apart leave a 25-unit link between them,
 * shorter than a bus. A bus turning right off it still has its rear on the
 * link, swung across the lane beside it, while its front is in the turn - and
 * a car stands in that lane, a few units short of its stop line.
 *
 * The conflict sweep only placed a body where its front had reached the stop
 * line or beyond, so the waiting car was inside no zone at all: nothing held
 * the bus for it, and nothing held it short of the bus. Measured on this map
 * before the fix, with these seeds: a truck over a sedan, a bus over a truck,
 * a truck over a hatch.
