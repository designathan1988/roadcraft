/**
 * TWO LANES INTO ONE ZIP.
 *
 * An avenue narrowing into a street merges its two lanes into one at the
 * taper. The merge zone was claimed by one car at a time until its body had
 * left the junction, and a stream from one lane kept it for as long as it kept
 * rolling (each follower joined the claim ahead of it), so the head of the
 * other lane stood at the taper for over twenty seconds. Now the car nearer
 * the shared lane is FOLLOWED across movements (`mergeObstacle`), the next
 * car may merge in behind it (`mergeFollows`), and the lanes take turns
 * (`zipperHolds`).
